# Project Context: PDM BOM Tool 2.1

## User Background
- Zero coding experience
- Learning Claude Code CLI (first time using it)
- Familiar with regular Claude but new to Code's file/command capabilities

## Project Details
- **Type**: Single HTML file BOM (Bill of Materials) management tool
- **Current State**: Has existing code in HTML, handoff document, and a plan for next steps

## Current Workflow
- Manages versions manually by creating numbered copies (e.g., "BOM Tool 2.0-1", "BOM Tool 2.0-2")
- No git experience yet, but interested in learning for better version control, needs hand-holding
- git installed on windows machine

## What User Wants to Do Next
- Work on the BOM tool with existing HTML, handoff documentation, and implementation plan
- Continue development with guidance on next features/improvements

## Key Learnings from Previous Session
- Understands Claude Code can read/write files directly (no copy/paste needed)
- Aware of git concepts for version control, but has no practice
- Knows to just describe what they want in plain English
- Context window is effectively unlimited via auto-summarization

## Notes for Next Session
- User has handoff document and plan files - ask which files to read
- Recommend git setup for safety net before making changes
- Keep explanations concise and practical
- User prefers learning by doing rather than lengthy explanations
