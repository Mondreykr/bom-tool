Thought 1
- tool should load X(n) and show hierarchy (collapsed by default) with state (IFU or IFP vs WIP where WIP is everything else) in a nice bubble or pill or something in the UI the reads well and can be coloured nicely (fit the UI) red or green, red for WIP, green for the other. Then also having a button that hides WIP. Note that children of an assembly item that's WIP should hide. But not the assembly item itself if its parent is Released, per the requirements. E.g., if A5 is WIP and A1 is released (parent), then A5 should still show, but A5's children would not.
- once B(n-1) is loaded (if it exists where n>1), the user should also have a toggle to hide the B(n-1) substitutions. And they should be shown and highlighted a soft yellow by default.
- it should also flag any items that are components which are WIP and have a parent that is Released. That's a critical error and should have been caught. In fact it should block progression with the tool if detected.

Thought 2
- UI approach, what do you think we should do and why? The tool itself will be used by others for the existing 3 tabs. This new function is for engineering. Doesn't mean it can't be a fourth tab. It might be simpler. I'm not sure of the options or function or pros/cons or your judgement. 
- well it might not detect no prior BOM because the XML itself might have REV1+ if the GA was issued or cycled before the first XML formally was used. So it needs to be a trigger or question or something within the program, maybe it's like something about it being the first ifp (ie IFP REV0) and if that's true then you check that and it changes the code a bit? The tool itself needs to produce the IFP REV0 artifact B(0). It must do that. The tool always produces B(n), for n >= 0. X(0) will be the feed/source to the tool to produce B(0), but "n" for X(n) is not necessarily the assembly or XML's internal revision. It's just the first XML contributing to B(0). Is that your understanding?
- after producing B(n), it should load for the other tabs too yes. That way you have opportunity to evaluate. You don't have to do anything with the other 3 tabs or make outputs, you may just produce the JSON B(n) file as the artifact that someone else can load into the tool. What do you think? Perhaps some of this is relevant right now or may have implications so I'll brain dump it here just in case it influences:

- Also, is the tool supposed to be able to receive a JSON file now too if those are the new B(n) files? What happens to the original XMLs? can users still load them like before, we just support more? thoughts?
