Features
- Upon initial file load, I want to see the actual State name (Issued for Use or Issued for Purchasing or Under Revision etc.) but still keeping the green/red pill based on state group (Released vs WIP). Or actually, even better, I want a toggle so that the State column can be switched from the default showing either RELEASED or WIP to the actual state name.
- I want to be able to see both BOMs from JSON and XML side by side so I can see for myself. Like I'm looking at it after it merged and I see it grafted. But I can't look at the XML and see what it is showing since it's X(N) and I can't see B(n-1) either. The code grafted from B(n-1) because X(n) had a WIP assembly, but I have no visibility of the X(n) and B(n-1) BOMs right? What do you think of this? How would it be done so it's out of the way but can be seen if you want? Theoretically you could trace back and confirm the table showing the graft is good because you could see the tree and states.
- I want a Reset button on IFP Merge tab (basically restores to unmerged with files uploaded)


Later Features
- I want to be able to hover my cursor over any field or card that isn't "self-evident" in its meaning and have a clear and plain explanation pop up that would help people who know PDM but don't understand what's going on here and this tool is new. So you'll have to help me figure out what those fields areas of the UI are and so on.
- I'd like a help section that pops down or open or something that explains things real simply for someone new, what it is, what things mean, steps etc. Succint.
- dark mode
