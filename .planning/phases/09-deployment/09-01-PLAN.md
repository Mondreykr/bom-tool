<objective>
Run pre-flight checks and enable GitHub Pages deployment for the refactored BOM Tool.

Purpose: This is the first time the refactored multi-file application will run in a real browser. All 8 prior phases were verified only through automated Node.js tests because corporate IT blocks localhost web servers. Deploying to GitHub Pages provides the HTTPS serving required for ES6 modules to load.

Output: Live BOM Tool at https://mondreykr.github.io/bom-tool/ with all JS/CSS files loading correctly.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Pre-flight verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the automated test suite to confirm the 2/4 baseline holds before deployment:

```bash
cd test && node run-tests.js
```

Verify result is exactly 2/4 passing (Tests 3 and 4 pass, Tests 1 and 2 fail). This is the expected baseline established in Phase 1 and maintained through all 8 phases.

Then verify the deployment-critical file structure:
1. Confirm index.html exists at repository root (not in a subdirectory)
2. Confirm index.html line 7 loads SheetJS CDN BEFORE the module script on line 393
3. Confirm the module script tag uses relative path: `src="js/main.js"` (no leading slash)
4. Confirm all import statements in js/ files use relative paths (`./` or `../`), never absolute paths starting with `/`
5. Confirm css/styles.css link in index.html uses relative path: `href="css/styles.css"`

If any of these checks fail, fix the issue before proceeding to deployment. All paths must be relative for GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment (site will be at /bom-tool/ not /).

No files are modified by this task -- it is read-only verification.
  </action>
  <verify>
Test output shows "2/4 tests passed". All file paths confirmed relative (no leading slashes in src/href attributes or import statements).
  </verify>
  <done>Pre-flight checks pass: 2/4 test baseline confirmed, all paths verified relative, file structure matches deployment requirements.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Enable GitHub Pages</name>
  <what-built>Pre-flight verification confirms the repository is deployment-ready. The gh CLI is not installed, so GitHub Pages must be enabled through the web UI.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Enable GitHub Pages by following these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to: https://github.com/Mondreykr/bom-tool
2. Click "Settings" (gear icon, top of the repository page)
3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: select "main"
   - Folder: select "/ (root)"
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 1-3 minutes for the initial deployment
7. Visit: https://mondreykr.github.io/bom-tool/
8. Confirm the page loads (you should see "BOM Tool" header and three tab buttons)

IMPORTANT: If the repository is currently PRIVATE, GitHub Pages will not work on a free plan. You would need to either:
- Make the repository public (Settings -> General -> Danger Zone -> Change visibility)
- Or upgrade to GitHub Pro

If the page loads and you see the BOM Tool interface, type "deployed" to continue.
If you get a 404 or blank page, describe what you see.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "deployed" when the site loads at https://mondreykr.github.io/bom-tool/, or describe the error you see.</resume-signal>
</task>

- Automated tests confirm 2/4 baseline (no regressions from Phases 1-8)
- GitHub Pages enabled and serving from main branch root
- https://mondreykr.github.io/bom-tool/ loads BOM Tool interface
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The BOM Tool is live at https://mondreykr.github.io/bom-tool/ and the page loads without a 404 error. The application header and tab buttons are visible. Detailed functional verification happens in Plan 02.
